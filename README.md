This is the official repository for the COLIBRI/CAGIRE Preprocessing Software (preproc).

CAGIRE is a near-infrared imager (J, H) that will be mounted on the COLIBRI telescope (San Pedro Martir, Mexico).
As a part of the ground segment of SVOM, CAGIRE is designed to perform systematic followups of gamma-ray burst afterglows.


A complete description of CAGIRE's specifications and performance is available in [Nouvel de la Fleche et al. (2023)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ExA...tmp...39N/abstract).
